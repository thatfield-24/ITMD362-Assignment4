Your README.txt must include:

The design you implemented
Description of your JavaScript interactions
Any challenges you face
 

The design I implemented is based off the linked Figma file. The Figma design is actually based off of the original wireframe for a website design I had previously completed.

The current challenges I have faced is that since I exported the HTML and CSS code directly from Figma the naming conventions have been rough. I am currently treating it like a code review by going through the HTML and CSS files to check for syntax and basic structuring. 
At this point it seems like it has just about matched the amount of effort it would have taken to get to here. Most of the Figma code was already using flex-box however certain sections may work better in a grid layout so trying to reverse that feels like it is taking more time than if I would have just started with my own code.
Yea. This might be worse than just doing it myself. (INSERT HEAD EXPLOSION EMOJI HERE) This feels like cleaning up AI generated code.  I need to readd the Contact Us Section. It has become easier to just entirely scrap it since it wasn't an actual form anyways. 
Hero section is currently not stretching properly so need to add that. Will also go back and add the Contact Form in and will then begin Javascript interactivity including hamburger menu in smaller screen sizes, proper contact submission form, javascript map to find the location.
